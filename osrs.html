                    <hr>
                        <p>Old School RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Jagex. 
                        The game was released on 22 February 2013. When Old School RuneScape launched, it was originally an August 2007 build of RuneScape. 
                        However, it has since received engine improvements, new content, and quality of life updates largely decided by in-game polls. 
                        Despite having a smaller development team and a slower relative update schedule, Old School RuneScape has a larger player-base than RuneScape. 
                        A mobile version for Android and iOS was released in October 2018.</p> <!--Paragraph copied and pasted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape-->

                    <hr>
                    <p>One thing Old School Runescape is known for is the questlines and amount of detail there is in them. Other MMORPG's will have you travel somewhere and kill
                        a certian amount of creatures/Npcs but not this game as each quest is unique. Some quests need you to complete other ones before you can start them, others 
                        need you to be certain levels in certain skills and after completing quests of a certain quest line you will unlock new areas of the map that allow your skilling
                        to be taken to the next level with new bosses located there or just to bump up the experience rates the path quests open up is endless. As your character starts to 
                        develop so do the quests from stepping off tutorial island to helping the chef in Lumbridge castle bake a cake for the duke to slaying a dragon underneath Crandor.</p>
