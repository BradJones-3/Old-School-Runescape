# Introduction
This website was designed for the company Jagex for the game Old School Runescape. The focus of this site is to create an online presence allowing new players, present players 
and any returning players to find out what is happening in game and to find any relavant information about the game.

and Old School RuneScape, collectively known as the world's largest free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Jagex has one of the longest running 
MMORPG games which has now been running for 20 years. The purpose for this website is to promote Jagex's game to a new audience as well as keeping the present players up to date.

![Site Map](assets/reame-images/Site-map.jpeg)

## Skeleton

### Home Page

### Osrs Page

### Useful Links Page

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours used throughout the website are orange text with a background of grey that is transparent to let the user still see the background image used, with the navbar and footer
both having a strong red colour that when hovered uses the same orange colour as the main content on the page.

The colours was chosen to make sure the text stands out from the background and also using the 'Psychological Effects of Colour' to evoke feelings of warmth when browsing the page.

### Typography

The pairing of the fonts [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text_type=custom) and also [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom) with 
Sans Serif as a backup should the fonts not be able load due to a import fail.

For the main content of the website Roboto is being used to keep the text consistent. The font Lato was used for the alert box on the mainpage to seperate and to stand out to catch the 
cutsomers eyes.

### Imagery

The imagery used within the website are used to keep the style consistent from page to page to keep the website visually appeasing.
The imagery visually keeps in theme with the website and stands out when used.

Each image has alternative text so that in an event of the element not being able to load.

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the website has a consistent navigational system:
* The **header** contains a **logo** placed in the upper left hand corner that allows the users to return to the homepage when clicked and also the **navigation bar** in the top right of the page.
* The **footer** contains each of the companies social media pages and is indicated with the appropriate icon to each of the accounts.

### Homepage
The homepage has a consistent layout on all devices with the content placed in the middle of the page, to allow easy and fast access to the information the customer may require upon their visit.
* Alert - The alert is occupying 75% of the webpage to keep the page flowing order consistent with the content below.
* Video and Birthday Image - Both of these elements occupy 75% of the page to keep inline with the layout on the page the video will autoplay when visiting the homepage to catch the users attention on 
the newest piece of content, and the birthday image is placed underneath with some of the games most recognisable NPC's and with a short explanation above the image to give the players a small explanation
of what is happening in game at the moment.

### Osrs Page
The OSRS page is a page dedicated to give people visiting the website information about the game and is also layed out the same as the **Homepage** to keep the wesbite consistent.
* Video - Like the homepage we are trying to get the users attention straight away so again the **Video** takes up 75% of the page again and is set to autoplay so the users are encouraged to unmute and 
to watch the video to learn what the game is from the people who create the game and push new content each week.
* Small Paragraphs - The paragraphs follow the suit of the whole webiste with the width set to 75%. Each will give details about what the game has to offer and is known for. They will explain what options 
the players have to play whether that be Free-to-Play or a Paid Membership. The other will give the players an insight on the quests they will encounter upon entering the game.

### Useful Links Page
This page of the website is to allow any person who visits the site to go and explore the wide range of content avaliable to them, it will contain links to a number of other sites that could 
help get the player use to the game and also to feel part of the **Runescape** community.

on the **Twitch** webiste.

take up 75% of the page with the image underneath keeping the size of its original size to keep the image from becoming strecthed and breaking the theme of the website.
* Client Links - This section will allow the players visiting the website to be able to choose which client they would like to play the game on with the risks of playing on the third-party

 ## Issues And Bugs
 The developer came across multiple bugs when implementing some features on the website, the ones that was more noticeable, along with the solutions are listed below:

 **Image Element Bug** - A bug was detected early in development with the image being displayed. In trying to implement a responsive image where the image wouldn't line up with other content, in searching 
 online through Google, the developer came across a similar question asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43226511/how-can-i-center-an-image-in-bootstrap) which explained that **<img>** is an 
 inline element which was causing the image used to display off center.

 **Navbar Bug** - A bug was detected when trying to change the colour of the navbar from the standard blue to the orange that is used throughout the website, whilst looking for the cause and for a solution, the developer 
 found a similar question that was asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46237610/bootstrap-4-navbar-color-wont-change). It was changed to keep in line with the websites colours and theme.

 **Iframe Bug** A bug was found when trying to make the multiple iframe elements to autoplay when visiting each page, the developer found a solution that only worked on older versions of web browsers, so had to return to 
 try and find a solution to the problem which was found again using the webiste [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40685142/youtube-autoplay-not-working) which was adapted to the 
 web url followed by "?autoplay" to allow the video to autoplay when that page is visited. The developer also tried to get the iframe to play with sound but due to the 2018 Google user changes 
 which doesn't allow this to occur giving the users more control on playback commands.
