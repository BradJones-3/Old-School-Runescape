                    <p>The Old School Wiki is a webiste that helps the players with anything they need to know whether that be how to obtain a certain item from a monster or to help you along a quest 
                    with thier in-depth guides. The site is ran by the players and written by the players and it is now intergrated into the game client itself to make the journey of getting any help 
                    needed fast and easy (You can find the logo underneath your world map). The players have ran and maintained the site since the launch of Old School Runescape back in 2013.
                    You can also find the link for the wiki underneath this paragraph.

                    <h4 class="clients-heading">Clients to Play The Game</h4>
                <hr>
                    <p>There are many clients avaliable to any player wanting to play the game but only three that Jagex advise to use, two being official clients and one being a third party client. 
                        We'll start off by advising the player to use the official Old School Runescape client and also the newly released Steam client which ups the frames per second and a smoother 
                        feel to the game whereas the older client is capped at 60 fps, with Steams all you have to do is link your steam account to your Old School one and its that simple no more putting 
                        in your password just one click of a button and you're all set to explore the world known as Gielinor. With the next client although Jagex allows players to use it we can't guarentee 
                        that your account is safe so we only advise using the official clients avaliable, that being said the creator of this client is working with Old School Runescape Mods as to what plug-ins 
                        are being added without damaging the integrity of the game, RuneLite adds overlays to the game which make it a little eaiser for any player to play. Some of the plug-ins help players 
                        how to complete a clue scroll, to easily identify any ground items dropped after killing creatures accross Gielinor and also allows a smoother gameplay. We have included links to all 
                        underneath this section to allow access to any you prefer.
